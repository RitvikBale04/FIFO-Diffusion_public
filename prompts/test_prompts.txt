A black car drives on a road next to the ocean and this road is also next to the sand dunes. The car drives forward at a consistent speed and the road remains straight with minimal change in between scenes. The waves are gently rocking back and forth in the background.
The car should continue driving forward on the road through the mountainous terrain. The car should not drive too fast and should flow smoothly through the terrain.
A teal robot stands in a kitchen in front of a countertop with a metal bin on it. The robot should very slowly walk around the kitchen not moving too far from its original position. The camera remains static, capturing the robot's poised stance amidst the orderly environment.
The airplane should continue flying forward in the sky and should be centered in the camera's view. The clouds and sky should be visible in the background.
The spaceship should continue thrusting upward in space and should be centered in the camera's view. The smoke beneath the spaceship should be visible.
